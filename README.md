## USER STORY
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## REQUIREMENTS
*   GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
    - WHEN I load their portfolio
        THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
    - WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
        THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
    - WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
        THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
    - WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
        THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
    - WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    THEN I am taken to that deployed application
    - WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
        THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
